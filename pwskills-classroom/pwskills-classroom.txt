--->Array Problems
Q9. Calculate the sum of all the element in the given array.
Q10. Find the max. value out of all the elements in the array.
Q11. Search of the given element id present in the array or not and find the index. if not present then return the index as -1 (Linear search). 
Q12. Find the last occurrence of an element x in a given array.
    Exp: traverse through the whole vector and compare the current element with the target element 'x' and if it maches then it will be out last seen index.
Q13. Count the number of occurrences of a particular element x.
Q14. Count the no. of element strictly greater than x.
Q15. Check if the give array is shorted or not.
Q16. Find the difference between the sum of elements at even indices to the sum of elements at off indices.
Q17. Find the total number of pairs in the array whose sum is equal to the given value x.
Q18. Count the number of triplets whose sum is equal to a given value x.
Q19. Find the unique no. in a given array where all the elements are repeated twice with one value being unique.
Q20. Find the second largest value in a given array.
Q21. Rotate the given array 'v' by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Q22. Foe Q inputs, check of the given no. is present in the array or not.
    Note:-value of all the array is less than 10^5

Q23. Short an array containing only 0's and 1's.
    Input:[1,0,1,0,0,1]
    Output:[0,0,0,1,1,1]
Q24. Given an array of integer 'a', move all the even integers at the begnning of the array followed by all the odd integers. The relative order of odd or even integer does not matter. Return any array that satisfies the condition.
    Input:[1,2,3,4,5]
    Output:[4,2,3,1,5]
Q25. Given an integer array 'a' shorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number shorted in non-decreasing/increasing prder.
    Input:[-10,-3,2,5,6]
    Output:[4,9,25,36,100]
--->>>Prefix Sum
Q26. Given an integer 'a', return the prefix sum/running sum in the same array without creating a new array.
    Input:[5,4,1,2,3]
    Output:[5,9,10,12,15]
Q27. Check if we can partion an input array into two subarrays with equal sum. More formally, check that the prefix sum of a part of the array is equal to the suffix sum of the rest of the array.
    Input:[5,2,3,4]
    Output:True
Q28. Given an array of integer 'a', of size n. For q number of inputs, print the sum of values in a given range of indices from l(starting index for the range) to r(ending index for the range), both l and r included in the sum.
    more formally, print a[l]+a[l+1]+a[l+2]+.....+a[r] for each q.
    Note: Array 'a' follows 1-based indexing i.e. element 1 is at index 1 and not 0, as usually is.
    Input: 5 //no. of element in array.
        5 1 2 3 4 //all the elements (space seprated)
        4 //value of Q
        1 1 //l and r for the 1st q, q=1
        1 3 //l and r for the 2st q, q=2
        4 5 //l and r for the 3st q, q=3
        1 5 //l and r for the 4st q, q=4
    Output: 
    5 //sum from a[1] to a[1] i.e. 5 itself
    8 //sum from a[1] to a[3] i.e. 5+1+2=8
    7 //sum from a[4] to a[5] i.e. 4+3=7
    15 //sum from a[1] to a[5] i.e. 5+1+2+3+4=15
