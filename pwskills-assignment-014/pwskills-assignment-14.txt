Q1. Given an nxm matrix ‘a’, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

    Example 1:
    Input: a =[[1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]]
    Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
    Explanation: Create four pointers for traversing in all the four directions. Then just traverse from left to right
    first and keep adding the elements in our answer. Do the same while traversing from top to bottom, then
    from right to left and from down to up. Finally increment the left and up pointer and decrement the right
    and down pointer as the size of the grid has been reduced. Make sure to keep a check on the answer that
    the maximum size of the answer can be when all the elements are present in it ie n x m.

Q2. Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.
    Example 1:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: [[1,2,3],
    [8,9,4],
    [7,6,5]]
    Explanation: Create four pointers for traversing in all the four directions. For any input n,we need to add
    elements in matrix from 1 to n^2 so keep a value pointer ‘val’ that we will keep incrementing as we assign the
    values. Generate an empty matrix and traverse from left to right, then from up to down, then from right to left
    and finally from down to up. Finally increment the left and up pointer and decrement the right and down
    pointer as the size of the grid has been reduced. Make sure to keep a check on the ‘val’ that it should exceed
    n^2.
