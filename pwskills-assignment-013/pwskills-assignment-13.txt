Q1. Given a 2D matrix with m rows and n columns containing integers. Print and return the row
    number with maximum sum in the array.

    Note: In case multiple rows have the same sum then return any row number with that sum.
    m=3
    n=3
    arr[] = {{1,9,6}, {4,5,2}, {7,8,3}}
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The 3rd row has the maximum sum which is 18
    m=3
    n=3
    arr[] = {{1,2,3}, {1,3,2}, {2,1,3}}
    Output: 1
    Explanation: All the rows have the same sum i.e. 6 so return any row number.

Q2. Given a matrix arr[][] of integers, print the prefix sum matrix for it.
    Sample Input:[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
    Sample Output:[[1,3,6],[5,12,21],[12,27,45]]
    Sample Input:[[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
    Sample Output:[[1,1,2],[1,2,3]]


Q3 - You are given an m x n integer matrix grid. Here m>=3 and n>=3
    We define an hourglass as a part of the matrix with the following shape:
    [[A,A,A],
    [ ,A, ],
    [A,A,A]]
    Return the maximum sum of the elements of an hourglass.
    Note that an hourglass cannot be rotated and must be entirely contained within the matrix.
    Sample Input: [[1,2,3],
                    [4,5,6],
                    [7,8,9]]
    Sample Output: 35
    Explanation: This has only one hourglass shape i.e. 1+2+3+5+7+8+9=35

    Sample Input: [[6,2,1,3],
    [4,2,1,5],
    [9,2,8,7],
    [4,1,2,9]]
    Sample Output:30
    Explanation: Amongst all possible hourglass in this matrix the maximum sum will be of the hourglass
    6+2+1+2+9+2+8
