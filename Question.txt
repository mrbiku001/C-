Q1 - Take 2 integer values in two variables x and y and print their product. (Easy)
	Sample Input : x=2, y=4 (Both integers)
	Sample Output : 8
Q2 - Print the ASCII value of character ‘U’. (Easy)
	Sample Input : already mentioned as ‘U’
	Sample Output : 85
Q3 - Write a C++ program to take length and breadth of a rectangle and print its area. (Easy)
	Sample Input : 7, 4
	Sample Output : 28
Q4 - Write a C++ program to calculate the cube of a number. (Easy)
	Sample Input : 4	
	Sample Output : 64
Q6 - Write a C++ program to swap two numbers with the help of a third variable. (Hard)
	Sample Input : 2, 3
	Sample Output : 3, 2
Q5 - Write a C++ program to find size of basic data types. (Medium)
	Sample Input : Nil (Here it is expected that we explore the size of each data type that would be
	used commonly in the programs ahead. We can simply make use of sizeof(datatype) operator
	to accomplish this. Give it a try to know the data types in depth)
	Sample Output :
	Size of fundamental data types :
	The sizeof(char) : 1 bytes
	The sizeof(short) : 2 bytes
	The sizeof(int) : 4 bytes
	The sizeof(long): 4 bytes
	The sizeof(long long) : 8 bytes
	The sizeof(float) : 4 bytes
	The sizeof(double) : 8 bytes
	The sizeof(long double) : 12 bytes
	The sizeof(bool) : 1 bytes

Q1 - Write a program to check whether two numbers (entered by user) are equal or not. (Easy)
	Sample Input 1: 1, 2
	Sample Output 1: 0
	Sample Input 2: 2, 2
	Sample Output 2: 1
Q2 - Write a program to take the values of two variables a and b from the keyboard and then check if both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true. (Easy)
	Sample Input 1 : 1, 2
	Sample Output 1: 0
	Sample Input 2: 2, 2
	Sample Output 2: 1
Q3 - There are 45 total pupils in the class, 25 of whom are boys. Write a program to find how many girls received grades "A" if 17 boys made up 80% of the students that received grades "A". (Medium)
	Sample Input : 45
	Sample Output : 19

	Sample Input : 12345
	Sample Output : 1+4=5
Q5 - Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a 3 digit number. (Hard)
	Sample Input : 123
	Sample Output : 6

	Sample Input : 8 10
	Sample Output :
	Sum = 18
	Difference = -2
	Product = 80
	Division = 0.8

Q1 - Write a program which takes the values of length and breadth from user and check if it is a square or not. (Easy)
	Sample Input :
	Enter length: 5
	Enter breadth: 4
	Sample Output : It is a rectangle
Q2 - Write a program to print absolute value of a number entered by the user. (Easy)
	Sample Input: -1
	Sample Output: 1
Q3- Write a program to take input from user for Cost Price (C.P.) and Selling Price(S.P.) and calculate Profit or Loss. (Medium)
	Explanation :
	Formula for profit and loss
	Profit = S.P - C.P
	Loss = C.P - S.P
	(S.P is Selling Price and C.P is Cost Price)
	Sample Input :
	Enter cost price: 4000
	Enter selling price: 9560
	Sample Output :
	Profit = 5560
Q4- Write a program to print positive number entered by the user, if user enters a negative number, it is skipped.(Medium)
	Sample Input : Enter an integer: -6
	Sample Output : The number is negative and skipped
Q5- Create a calculator using switch statement to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
	Sample Input :
	Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): -
	Enter two numbers:
	6
	8
	Sample Output : 6 - 8 = -2
Q6. Write a program to calculate marks to grades . Follow the conversion rule as given below :(Medium)
	100 – 90 A+
	90 – 80 A
	80 – 70 B+
	70 – 60 B
	60 – 50 C
	50 – 40 D
	40 – 30 E
	30 – 0 F

	Sample Input : Enter Your Marks: 98
	Sample Output : Your Grade is A+
